The aim of the RECAP Preterm project is to improve the health, development and quality of life of children and adults born very preterm in the European Union by developing the \textit{RECAP Preterm Cohort Platform}, a sustainable, geographically diverse and multidisciplinary database of national and European cohorts of babies born very preterm or with very low birth weight, with data collected over a period of 30 years and designed to optimize the use of populational data for research and innovation in healthcare, social and education policy.\\
I developed a web app integrated into the project website, which allows authenticated users to rapidly perform simple/exploratory statistical analysis without requiring specific knowledge about the database access tools, and presents results in a graphic fashion. For that I used NodeJS and DATAShield, as well as JavaScript and R.
